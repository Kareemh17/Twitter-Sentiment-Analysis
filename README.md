# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Active Issues:

Tweets are mined on a most recent basis regardless of source, based on the date entered. This leads to possibly high bias in the resulting graph as it is possible that all the tweets mined from a single day could be from a small group of like-minded tweeters.

Textblob uses a pre-trained NLP model, currently learning on how to create my own to maximize efficiency and accuracy of sentiment calculation.
